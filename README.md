# Marvelous Cinematic Unisearch

Many fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU for short) have to "search" for the right order of the movies every time they want to watch them back-to-back like a series. 
In doing so, it's easy to lose track of the different phases in which the films were released.

### But with the Marvelous Cinematic Unisearch (MCU app for short), the long search is a thing of the past.
