# Marvelous Cinematic Unisearch

Many fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU for short) have to "search" the right order of the movies each time to be able to watch them one after the other like a series. 
It's easy to lose track of all the phases in which the films were released.

### But with the Marvelous Cinematic Unisearch (MCU-App for short) the long search is a thing of the past.

In the MCU-App, you will be able to navigate through the phases and the chronological order of the movies. 

Also planned is
- a comment function for your own opinion.

- a function with which one can mark the films already looked at as seen.

- And in the later I plan some entertainment in the app in the form of a Marvelous - quiz.
